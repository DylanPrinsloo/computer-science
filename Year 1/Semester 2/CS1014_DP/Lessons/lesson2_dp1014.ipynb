    "So When converting a **top-down dynamic programming (DP) solution** into a **bottom-up DP solution**, the main thing that **must** be done is:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Find the correct order in which to iterate over the states.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s why:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Top-Down DP** uses recursion, and it solves problems as it encounters them. It starts with the big problem and recursively breaks it down into smaller subproblems, solving them when needed. Since it's recursive, the order of solving the subproblems doesn’t matter as long as we eventually solve the base cases and calculate the necessary subproblems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bottom-Up DP** works differently. It **iterates** through all the subproblems in a specific **order**. The key is that when solving a subproblem, all the previous subproblems it depends on **must already be solved**. This requires us to figure out the correct order to process the subproblems, starting from the base cases and working up to the final solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - In bottom-up, you can’t just pick any subproblem to solve at random—you need to solve them in the **right order** to ensure all dependencies are resolved.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **So, to convert from top-down to bottom-up**, we need to:\n",
    "- **Identify the correct order** in which the subproblems should be solved so that each one depends only on results that have already been calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything else (like the base cases and recurrence relation) usually stays the same. The **only new thing** in bottom-up is **iterating over the subproblems in the correct order**.\n",
