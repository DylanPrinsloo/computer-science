    "\n",
    "You are given a 0-indexed integer array `obstacles` of length `n`, where `obstacles[i]` describes the height of the `i`-th obstacle. For every index `i` between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive), find the length of the longest obstacle course in `obstacles` such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You choose any number of obstacles between 0 and `i` inclusive.\n",
    "- You must include the `i`-th obstacle in the course.\n",
    "- You must put the chosen obstacles in the same order as they appear in `obstacles`.\n",
    "- Every obstacle (except the first) is taller than or the same height as the obstacle immediately before it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return an array `ans` of length `n`, where `ans[i]` is the length of the longest obstacle course for index `i` as described above.\n",
